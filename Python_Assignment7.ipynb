        "Q.1: What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The re.compile() function returns Regex objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2: Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3: What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The search() method returns Match objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4: From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5: In the regex which created from the r&#39;(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover?\n",
        "Group 2? Group 1?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6: In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
        "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7: The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
        "the two options?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8: In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The | character signifies matching “either, or” between two groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9: In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The ? character can either mean “match zero or one of the preceding group” or be used to signify nongreedy matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10: In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The + matches one or more. The * matches zero or more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11: What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The {4} matches exactly Four instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches between Four and five instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12: What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
        "expressions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13: What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14: What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The .* performs a greedy match, and the .*? performs a nongreedy match.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15: What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Either [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16: What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17: What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
        "argument in re.compile()?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.18: If numReg = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;), what will numRegex.sub(&#39;X&#39;, &#39;11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4\n",
        "hen&#39;) return?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.19: What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20: How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must\n",

        "\n",
        "&#39;1234&#39; (which lacks commas)\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$') will create this regex, but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression.\n",
