It's frequently difficult to read a large program. Breaking the code down into smaller functions keeps the program structured, understandable, and reusable. The function can be reused countless times after it is defined.\n","\n","Q.2: When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called?\n","\n","Ans : The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.\n","\n","Q.3: What statement creates a function?\n","\n","Ans: In Python, you define a function with the def keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.\n","\n","Q.4: What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n","\n","Ans: A function is a piece of code which enhanced the reusability and modularity of your program. It means that piece of code need not be written again. A function call means invoking or calling that function. Unless a function is called there is no use of that function.\n","\n","Q.5: How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n","\n","Ans: There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.\n","\n","Q.6: What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n","\n","Ans: Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.\n","\n","Q.7: What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n","\n","Ans: A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.\n","\n","Q.8: If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n","\n","Ans: If no return statement appears in a function definition, control automatically returns to the calling function after the last statement of the called function is executed. In this case, the return value of the called function is undefined.\n","\n","Q.9: How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n","\n","Ans: To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.\n","\n","Q.10: What is the data type of None?\n","\n","Ans: None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.\n","\n","Q.11: What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n","\n","Ans: imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n","\n","Q.12: If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n","\n","Ans: This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n","\n","Q.13: What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n","\n","Ans: Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause.\n","\n","Q.14: What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n","\n","Ans: The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.\n","The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause."],"metadata":{"id":"bMqaDMUwbOp4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"rZnAOoxlfsiw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
